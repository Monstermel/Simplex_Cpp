# Simplex_Cpp

A C++ program to solve problems related to operation research. It has built-in several algorithms:
- Simplex (Two phases method)
- Branch and Bound
- Transport Simplex
- Hungarian Method
- Minimun spanning tree
- Dijkstra
- Floyd
- Max flow

The program works reading from a .problem file and which also has its own syntax. There are several examples in the problems directory.
This project started as part of my operation research course. I enjoyed and learnt a lot throught it so now I'am planning to turn it into an C++ library.
